Today, I am going to explore a recursive solution to a fascinating probability problem- what is the probability that the sum of $n$ dice sums to $m$? I will present the probabilistic background used, followed by the recursive solution's implementation in Python.

## The problem at hand

Recall that the problem is defined as the following:

*What is the probability that the sum of n dice is m?*

I find that when dealing with general probability questions like this, it is always a good idea to start with the base case and build upwards. For the sum of 2 dice, we can construct a table with $[1,6]$ on the vertical and horizontal axis respectively, and fill it in with the sums of the intersecting numbers. There will be $6^2$ possible outcomes, and we can count the number that sum to our required $m$ value. We can extend this idea to 3 dice, by extending the table out into 3 dimensions, but the this is a rather labour intensive process that doesn't scale very well further than this. We need a better idea to move forward with...

## A lovely recursive statement

Consider the following scenario again. We want to sum 2d6 dice, with random variables  $X_1$  and  $X_2$  respectively, to get some outcome $Y$. It is clear that the random variable $Y$ is defined as follows: $Y = X_1 + X_2$. Due to this relationship, we can compute the probability mass function for $Y$:

$$P_Y(y) = P(X_1 = 1)P(X_2 = y - 1) + P(X_1 = 2)P(X_2 = y - 2) + P(X_1 = 3)P(X_2 = y - 3) + \dots + P(X_1 = 6)P(X_2 = y - 6)$$

Using this idea, we can write the pmf for the sum of 3 dice, $Z$, as the following: $Z = X_1 + X_2 + X_3$, or rather $Z = Y + X_3$. Similarly, the pmf can be written as:

$$P_Z(z) = P(X_3 = 1)P(Y = z - 1) + P(X_3 = 2)P(Y = z - 2) + P(X_3 = 3)P(Y = z - 3) + \dots + P(X_3 = 6)P(Y = z - 6)$$

It is this recursive idea that we around going to exploit to generalise the problem for $n$ dice.

## Let's Code the Relationship!

The following Python code handles our problem nicely for relatively smaller n values (recursion isn't always the most efficient solution):

```python
def funct(sum_d, n_dice):
    '''
    recursive function to find probability of n_dice summing to sum_d  
    '''
    if n_dice == 1:
        if sum_d in range(1,7):
            return 1/6
        else:
            return 0
    else:
        return 1/6 * (funct(sum_d-1, n_dice-1)
                   + funct(sum_d-2, n_dice-1)
                   + funct(sum_d-3, n_dice-1)
                   + funct(sum_d-4, n_dice-1)
                   + funct(sum_d-5, n_dice-1)
                   + funct(sum_d-6, n_dice-1)
                  )
```
Using this function, we can now generate the probabilities for any $n$ dice, within computational limits. Let's generate the pmf for 2 dice:

And for 3 dice:

For 4 dice:

If you've ever done any statistics before, alarm bells will likely be going off at the shape of this distribution as we add in more dice. Let's explore this idea a little further in the next section.

## Central Limit Theorem

It appears that the distribution is converging on the a gaussian as we add in more coins. Let's overlay a normal with matching variance and mean to explore this idea a little more.

Seems like a pretty good fit already! Notice that some of the imperfection can be attributed to the precision loss due to the float datatype. If we take a look at 6 dice we can see the distribution matches the gaussian almost exactly.

This is happening as a direct result of a famous statistical result called the Central Limit Theorem. The CLT states that in many cases, when independent random variables are summed up, their sum tends towards a normal distribution, even if the variables themselves are not normally distributed. We can observe this exact phenomenon occurring above in this scenario. Just for fun, let's take a look at the pmf for 9 dice juxtaposed to the corresponding normal distribution:
