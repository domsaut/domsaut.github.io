I will present the probabilistic background used, followed by the recursive solution’s implementation in Python. The problem at hand Recall that the problem is defined as the following: What is the probability that the sum of n dice is m? I find ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Statistics Dashboard for Arithmetic Zetamac</title><link href="https://domsaut.github.io/posts/Zetamac-Statistics/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Statistics Dashboard for Arithmetic Zetamac" /><published>2021-12-18T16:09:00+13:00</published> <updated>2021-12-19T19:00:28+13:00</updated> <id>https://domsaut.github.io/posts/Zetamac-Statistics/</id> <content src="https://domsaut.github.io/posts/Zetamac-Statistics/" /> <author> <name>Domenico Sauta</name> </author> <category term="Python" /> <summary> In today's post, I step through how I developed a statistics dashboard for an online maths game Arithmetic Zetamac. Zetamac is a minimalist online speed maths game which, although serves its purpose very well, does not have a native statistics dashboard or way to store your previous scores. As someone interested in tracking progress over time, I would track my scores on a google doc- a very lab... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Bertrand's Box Paradox</title><link href="https://domsaut.github.io/posts/Bertrand-Box/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bertrand's Box Paradox" /><published>2021-12-14T16:36:00+13:00</published> <updated>2021-12-15T17:42:56+13:00</updated> <id>https://domsaut.github.io/posts/Bertrand-Box/</id> <content src="https://domsaut.github.io/posts/Bertrand-Box/" /> <author> <name>Domenico Sauta</name> </author> <category term="Probability" /> <summary> Have you ever solved a somewhat trivial problem, but felt like the mathematics deceived you? In today’s blog post I plan on walking through a rather elementary probability question whose solution employs an application of Bayes Law. I will also include a simple simulation as an additional unrigorous verification of my calculated solution to this problem. Bertrand’s Box Paradox The Bertrand ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Solving the Black Scholes PDE</title><link href="https://domsaut.github.io/posts/Solving-the-Black-Scholes-PDE/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Solving the Black Scholes PDE" /><published>2021-11-04T18:36:00+13:00</published> <updated>2021-11-04T18:36:00+13:00</updated> <id>https://domsaut.github.io/posts/Solving-the-Black-Scholes-PDE/</id> <content src="https://domsaut.github.io/posts/Solving-the-Black-Scholes-PDE/" /> <author> <name>Domenico Sauta</name> </author> <category term="Options Pricing" /> <summary> In this post, I intend to step through the Black Scholes (1973) options pricing model derivation from start to finish, in a complete and accessible way. In a previous post, I explored a way to derive the pricing model using stochastic calculus and risk neutral expectation. This time I will take a more ‘applied mathematics approach’ by deriving the Black Scholes PDE, transforming it into a more ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Green's Function and the Heat Equation</title><link href="https://domsaut.github.io/posts/Greens-Function-and-Heat-Equation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Green's Function and the Heat Equation" /><published>2021-11-03T18:36:00+13:00</published> <updated>2021-11-15T17:13:20+13:00</updated> <id>https://domsaut.github.io/posts/Greens-Function-and-Heat-Equation/</id> <content src="https://domsaut.github.io/posts/Greens-Function-and-Heat-Equation/" /> <author> <name>Domenico Sauta</name> </author> <category term="Mathematical Physics" /> <summary> The Heat Equation in one dimensional space is one of a handful of special partial differential equations that seem to pop up in a range of different applications within the mathematical physics, applied mathematics and finance disciplines respectively. In our case, it is defined as follows: \[\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\] With initial conditions $u... </summary> </entry> </feed>
