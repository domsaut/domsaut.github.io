## Hi! My name is Dom Sauta...

I am an undergraduate student at the University of Western Australia studying a Bachelor of Philosophy (hons) in Mathematics & Statistics and Finance; with a professional interest in statistical learning, big data, and quantitative finance.

I am passionate about mathematics, programming and the financial markets, and the intersection of these three fields. I have demonstrated quantitative research experience, and am skilled at programming in Python.

This blog is primarily a means for me to post things that I find interesting. Blog posts could range from project summaries to book reviews or anything in between. Basically, whatever I feel like sharing.

Feel free to reach out to me via email if you notice any mistakes or would like to discuss what you have read.
