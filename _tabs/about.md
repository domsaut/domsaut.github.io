## Hi! My name is Dom Sauta...

I am an undergraduate student at the University of Western Australia studying a Bachelor of Philosophy (hons) in Mathematics & Statistics and Finance; with a professional interest in statistical learning, big data, and quantitative finance.

I am passionate about mathematics, programming and the financial markets, and the intersection of these three fields. I have demonstrated quantitative research experience, and am skilled at Python (programming language).

This blog is primarily a means for me to share things I find interesting with people like you. Posts could range from project summaries to book reviews or anything in between. Basically, whatever I feel like sharing!

I love talking about the projects I am attacking right now. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me for a chat if youâ€™re interested.
